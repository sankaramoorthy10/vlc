How to save a theme

Navigate to the theme file, it should be a xaml file type on GitHub. Once you are viewing the file content click "Raw" on the top right corner and Ctrl +S to save the theme (make sure it's saved with .xaml extension).

Save the theme in your user data directory, usually in ~/AppData/Roaming/FlowLauncher/Themes directory. If not sure, from flow type flow launcher userdata then navigate to the Themes directory.

Select your new theme via flow's theme section.

Additional

We are planning a theme gallery menu on the website in the future, but is of low priority at this stage. If you've posted your themes here, they will be included when it's completed.
Since I often modify the design, there may be changes/new additions to the theme structure, which I'll mention these details here.
